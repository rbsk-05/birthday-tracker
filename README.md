BirthDay Tracker

It all started when my friend started calling me out when I couldnt remember her birthday. It was not just her birthday, I tend to forget most of my friend's birthday. They maybe relatively close friends, but i am bad at dates or even when I do remember, I wont have the slightest idea that it was that day which I missed. Of Course, I remember other birthdays but the majority lies on the other side of the fence.

So I saw this problem of mine and decided to develop a solution on my own, At first, I used to write down some names down in my Notes or my calendar. but I tend to miss it still. This is where my BIRTHDAY TRACKER comes in.

Now I can easily know my friend's birthday and even have a look at the recent ones I missed, all properly categorized and ready to not miss a birthday starting this year!
